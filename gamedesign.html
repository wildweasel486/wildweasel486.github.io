				Most of my game design knowledge comes from years of making mods for games in the Doom (id Tech 1) engine, focusing primarily on <a href="https://zdoom.org/index">ZDoom and its derivatives</a>. <strong>Cola 3</strong>, then, is the culmination of more than 15 years of experience in this field. More than just a one-gimmick mod, Cola 3 draws inspiration from many games both new and old, with weapons that fill specific niches, an upgrade system that rewards the player for staying loyal to their weapon of choice and staying in the thick of the action, and a rather over-the-top dedication to its off-brand soft drink theme. It is also my first Doom production that uses the new ZScript language, a C-like system that grants unprecedented access to the inner workings of the engine (which is mostly used to handle the, uh, "unique" melee weapon). Great care was taken for game balance, in particular a focus on ensuring that the player does not become too powerful, too quickly.</p>
