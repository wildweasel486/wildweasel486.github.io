				<p><i>Title:</i> <strong>Angle and Country</strong><br>
				<i>Date:</i> <strong>2016-Feb-09</strong><br>
				<i>Medium:</i> <strong>Photograph (untouched)</strong><br>
				<i>Camera:</i> <strong>Motorola Google Nexus 6</strong><br>
				<i>Location:</i> <strong>PCC Rock Creek Campus</strong> (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps?ll=45.568389,-122.859983&q=45.568389,-122.859983&hl=en&t=m&z=11" target="blank"><i>View on Google Maps</i></a>)<br><br>

				Taken from an upper-floor walkway at Portland Community College's Rock Creek campus, on a particularly clear early-spring afternoon. Most of my photography of scenes tends to be more to celebrate the scenes themselves; I'm not the sort of photographer who spends minutes agonizing over shutter speed and angle. This image is more or less a "point and shoot" photo, with no after-effects applied whatsoever.</p>

				<a href="images/image02.jpg" target="blank"><img src="images/image02thumb.jpg" alt="Guitar Cat On Stage" style="float:left;"></a>
				<p><i>Title:</i> <strong>Guitar Cat On Stage</strong><br>
				<i>Date:</i> <strong>2013-Feb-06</strong><br>
				<i>Medium:</i> <strong>Digital painting/sketch</strong><br>
				<i>Tools used:</i> <strong>ArtRage Studio 3, Wacom Bamboo Pen</strong><br><br>
				
				When I saw someone's photograph of their cat posing with a small toy guitar, I couldn't resist the urge to draw it. While I cannot locate the original photograph anymore (many apologies to the cat's owner), it was used as a reference for the image. Many hours were spent painstakingly sketching in the cat's fur texture with ArtRage's pencil tool, before coloration was added on a separate layer, followed by a simple hand-painted background to complete the piece.</p>

				<a href="images/image03.jpg" target="blank"><img src="images/image03thumb.jpg" alt="The Way of the Bird-Thing" style="float:left;"></a>
				<p><i>Title:</i> <strong>The Way of the Bird-Thing</strong><br>
				<i>Date:</i> <strong>2013-Mar-13</strong><br>
				<i>Medium:</i> <strong>Digital painting</strong><br>
				<i>Tools used:</i> <strong>ArtRage Studio 3, Wacom Bamboo Pen</strong><br><br>
				
				Intended more as an exercise in an unusual color palette, the titular "bird-thing" almost didn't get drawn, but I realized that there wasn't a focal point to the piece otherwise. This entire painting was done entirely without references. As with the cat above, much time was spent on the grass and other texturing. A drop-shadow effect was added to the bird-thing using an ArtRage layer effect, to save time doing it by hand. Everything else was done "traditionally" despite being entirely digital.</p>

				<p><i>Title:</i> <strong>Cyberpunk Dentistry</strong><br>
				<i>Date:</i> <strong>2016-May-07</strong><br>
				<i>Medium:</i> <strong>Photograph/Photo-manipulation</strong><br>
				<i>Tools used:</i> <strong>Adobe Photoshop CS6</strong><br>
				<i>Camera:</i> <strong>Motorola Google Nexus 6</strong><br>
				<i>Location:</i> <strong>OHSU Collaborative Life Sciences Building</strong> (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps?ll=45.503078,-122.672222&q=45.503078,-122.672222&hl=en&t=m&z=11" target="blank"><i>View on Google Maps</i></a>)<br><br>
				
				Originally just a photo snapshot I took while riding Portland's MAX Orange Line. This building stood out to me because its architecture resembles that of a mega-corporation from 1980s "cyberpunk" literature, in the tradition of movies like <i>Blade Runner</i> or <i>Johnny Mnemonic</i>. The resulting photo, while illustrative enough, really didn't feel "cyberpunk" enough to me, so I set about to digitally adding a more appropriately menacing sky and adjusting the contrast to suit. The title of the piece came about when I learned that the building was not a corporate headquarters, but a school of dentistry.</p>
