				<p><strong>Title:</strong> <i>Angle and Country</i><br>
				<strong>Date:</strong> <i>2016-Feb-09</i><br>
				<strong>Medium:</strong> <i>Photograph (untouched)</i><br>
				<strong>Camera:</strong> <i>Motorola Google Nexus 6</i><br>
				<strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?ll=45.568389,-122.859983&q=45.568389,-122.859983&hl=en&t=m&z=11" target="blank"><i>45째34'06.2"N 122째51'35.9"W</i></a><br><br>

				Taken from an upper-floor walkway at Portland Community College's Rock Creek campus, on a particularly clear early-spring afternoon. Most of my photography of scenes tends to be more to celebrate the scenes themselves; I'm not the sort of photographer who spends minutes agonizing over shutter speed and angle (because I've never owned a camera that offers such features). This image is more or less a "point and shoot" photo, with no after-effects applied whatsoever.</p>

				<a href="images/image02.jpg" target="blank"><img src="images/image02thumb.jpg" alt="Guitar Cat On Stage" style="float:left;"></a>
				<p><strong>Title:</strong> <i>Guitar Cat On Stage</i><br>
				<strong>Date:</strong> <i>2013-Feb-06</i><br>
				<strong>Medium:</strong> <i>Digital painting/sketch</i><br>
				<strong>Tools used:</strong> <i>ArtRage Studio 3, Wacom Bamboo Pen</i><br><br>
				
				I am, believe it or not, a big fan of cats and kittens. When I saw someone's photograph of their cat posing with a small toy guitar, I couldn't resist the urge to draw it. While I cannot locate the original photograph anymore (many apologies to the cat's owner), it was used as a reference for the image. Many hours were spent painstakingly sketching in the cat's fur texture with ArtRage's pencil tool, before coloration was added on a separate layer, followed by a hand-painted background (though not an overly detailed one, as the cat is the focus, not the background) to complete the piece.</p>

				<a href="images/image03.jpg" target="blank"><img src="images/image03thumb.jpg" alt="The Way of the Bird-Thing" style="float:left;"></a>
				<p><strong>Title:</strong> <i>The Way of the Bird-Thing</i><br>
				<strong>Date:</strong> <i>2013-Mar-13</i><br>
				<strong>Medium:</strong> <i>Digital painting</i><br>
				<strong>Tools used:</strong> <i>ArtRage Studio 3, Wacom Bamboo Pen</i><br><br>
				
				Intended more as an exercise in an unusual color palette, the "bird-thing" only got painted into the image because the tree didn't do much to draw the eye, despite being blue. This entire painting was done entirely without references. As with the cat above, much time was spent on the grass and other texturing. A drop-shadow effect was added to the bird-thing using an ArtRage layer effect, which is the only time I technically "cheated" with the painting. Everything else was done "traditionally" despite being entirely digital.</p>

				<p><strong>Title:</strong> <i>Cyberpunk Dentistry</i><br>
				<strong>Date:</strong> <i>2016-May-07</i><br>
				<strong>Medium:</strong> <i>Photograph/Photo-manipulation</i><br>
				<strong>Tools used:</strong> <i>Adobe Photoshop CS6</i><br>
				<strong>Camera:</strong> <i>Motorola Google Nexus 6</i><br>
				<strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?ll=45.503078,-122.672222&q=45.503078,-122.672222&hl=en&t=m&z=11" target="blank"><i>45째34'06.2"N 122째51'35.9"W</i></a><br><br>
				
				Originally just a photo snapshot I took while riding Portland's MAX Orange Line. This building stood out to me because its architecture resembles that of a mega-corporation from 1980s "cyberpunk" literature, in the tradition of William Gibson's <u>Neuromancer</u>. The resulting photo, while illustrative enough, really didn't feel "cyberpunk" enough to me, so I set about to digitally adding a more appropriately menacing sky and adjusting the contrast to suit. The actual building is the OHSU Collaborative Life Sciences Building, home of the OHSU School of Dentistry, hence the title.</p>
