				<p><i>Title:</i> <strong>Element Null</strong><br>
				<i>Date:</i> <strong>2016-Oct-18</strong><br><br>
				
				For Portland Community College's MM258 (Video Compositing II), my assignment was to create a mock opening for a television show. In order to come up with an engaging opening, I decided I wanted to come up with an actual "show" that it'd belong to, so I came up with Element Null, a drama-thriller series following a handful of disparate people (symbolized by the classical Elements) who do not know each other, but indirectly influence each other through their actions, while an amnesiac ("Null") struggles to discover his purpose.<br><br>
                
                Beyond the wishful-thinking of the chosen cast, the music chosen for this video is "Mother Earth of Dishonesty" from the Phantasy Star Online Original Sound Track.</p>

				<p><i>Title:</i> <strong>An Attack Is Not Taking Place</strong><br>
				<i>Date:</i> <strong>2015-Dec-05</strong><br><br>
				
				Using a lot of public-domain sources from the Prelinger Archives, I aimed to evoke the tension and paranoia of the early Cold War era. I did this by juxtaposing video of evacuation drills and military equipment with footage of college protests and anti-US posters and graffiti. I specifically tried to avoid any footage with actual fighting, and also any footage that pointed to any specific "enemy" nation to make it continually relevant.<br><br>

				<p><i>Title:</i> <strong>How Bad Could It Be? Spirit of Speed 1937</strong><br>
				<i>Date:</i> <strong>2012-Jan-15</strong><br><br>
				
				Video game reviews are extremely popular on YouTube, especially reviews of games that were either poorly received or forgotten. This video review is of <i>Spirit of Speed 1937</i>, one of the very few racing games that depicted a historical period, rather than the modern Grand Prix. While obscure, the game had a poor reputation, so I took it upon myself to see if I agreed. But just reviewing the game would not have been especially interesting, so I drafted the help of Edwyn "Omahdon" Tiong and many public-domain newsreel videos to present the review as an "authentic" piece of 1930s news media.</p>
