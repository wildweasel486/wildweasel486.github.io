				Two men and a donut - who is worthy of the prize? The men duel, only to find that there is a betrayer lurking in the shadows.<br><br>

				<p><i>Title:</i> <strong>An Attack Is Not Taking Place</strong><br>
				<i>Date:</i> <strong>2015-Dec-05</strong><br><br>
				
				Using a lot of public-domain sources from the Prelinger Archives, I aimed to evoke the tension and paranoia of the early Cold War era. I did this by juxtaposing video of evacuation drills and military equipment with footage of college protests and anti-US posters and graffiti. I specifically tried to avoid any footage with actual fighting, and also any footage that pointed to any specific "enemy" nation to make it continually relevant.</p>

				<p><i>Title:</i> <strong>How Bad Could It Be? Spirit of Speed 1937</strong><br>
				<i>Date:</i> <strong>2012-Jan-15</strong><br><br>
				
				Video game reviews are extremely popular on YouTube, especially reviews of games that were either poorly received or forgotten. This video review is of <i>Spirit of Speed 1937</i>, one of the very few racing games that depicted a historical period, rather than the modern Grand Prix. While obscure, the game had a poor reputation, so I took it upon myself to see if I agreed. But just reviewing the game would not have been especially interesting, so I drafted the help of Edwyn "Omahdon" Tiong and many public-domain newsreel videos to present the review as an "authentic" piece of 1930s news media.</p>
