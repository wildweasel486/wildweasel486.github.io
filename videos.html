				<p><strong>Title:</strong> <i>The Donut Duel</i><br>
				<strong>Date:</strong> <i>2015-Oct-26</i><br><br>
				
				Two men and a donut - who is worthy of the prize? The men duel, only to find that there is a betrayer lurking in the shadows (albeit unwittingly).<br><br>
				
				A video editing assignment from MM 235 Video Production at Portland Community College, focusing on editing for continuity. I'm also in the video myself, as the "third man." I don't really have any comments on how it felt to act in the film, aside from the fact that maybe I should have worn a different shirt.<br><br>

				<p><strong>Title:</strong> <i>An Attack Is Not Taking Place</i><br>
				<strong>Date:</strong> <i>2015-Dec-05</i><br><br>
				
				Using liberal public-domain sources from the Prelinger Archives, I aimed to evoke the tension and paranoia of the early Cold War era by juxtaposing video of evacuation drills and radar equipment with footage of college protests and anti-US posters and graffiti from the 1950s and 1960s, but specifically avoiding any footage with actual fighting, and absolutely avoiding footage that pointed to any specific "enemy" nation to make it continually relevant.</p>

				<p><strong>Title:</strong> <i>How Bad Could It Be? Spirit of Speed 1937</i><br>
				<strong>Date:</strong> <i>2012-Jan-15</i><br><br>
				
				One of my many attempts to get in on the ever-popular practice of reviewing video games for Youtube, I became interested in <u>Spirit of Speed 1937</u> as it was one of the very few racing games that depicted a historical period as opposed to modern racing. Unfortunately, it was not very good. But just reviewing the game would not have been especially interesting, so I drafted the help of Edwyn "Omahdon" Tiong and many public-domain newsreel videos to present the review as an "authentic" piece of 1930s news media.</p>
