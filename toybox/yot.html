					<dt>What is Yot?</dt>
						<dd>Yot is what you get when you take the idea of playing and turn it into a living thing. Yot looks like just a stack of letter blocks, but there's so much more that Yot can do that you'll just have to figure out!</dd>
					<dt>What can I do with Yot?</dt>
						<dd>Yot can appear in almost every part of Toybox. Yot is here to help if you don't know how to do something. Just tap on Yot to see what it has to say. You can also dress up Yot in funny clothes, like sunglasses, snorkels, and space suits, or paint Yot in any color you want.</dd>
					<dt>What can Yot do with me?</dt>
						<dd>Yot loves reading and drawing, and is happy to help out by reading things out loud, singing songs, or choosing colors. Yot will come up with ideas to help your imagination. Yot will also get to know you and what you like.</dd>
