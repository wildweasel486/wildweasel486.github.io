				<h1>For Parents</h1>
				
				<p>We know that growing up is a different experience for every child on the planet. Some kids love getting outside and playing sports and making friends, and other kids prefer to sit inside and read, or build, or draw. Because everybody's childhood is so different, we are committed to allowing Toybox to be tailor-made to fit as many possible tastes and preferences as possible, from colors to activities and everything else in between. Here are some of the ways you can customize Toybox.</p>
				
				<h2>The Parents Menu</h2>
				
				<p>Toybox Key (the included software found on Toybox's internal storage) allows easy access to the Parents Menu from a desktop computer, and is the central hub for receiving software updates and altering settings. The Parents Menu does not require an internet connection except to download updates. The menu may be used to change which name and gender Yot uses to address your child, delete all settings and reset the Toybox to factory defaults, individually enable or disable certain activities, or change the saved status of Toybox by adding or removing medals, dress-up items, or other things. The Parents Menu can also be used to check statistics, such as how often an activity is being used, which colors are being chosen most frequently, how many of each medal has been awarded to date, and technical information about battery life.<p>
				
				<p>If a desktop computer is not available, the Parents Menu may also be accessed directly from the Toybox interface. To access the Toybox Parents Menu, return to the main Toy Room by pressing the Home button, then tap and hold the Back and Home buttons together for five seconds. The on-screen instructions will lead you through the Parents Menu to make changes wherever you want.</p>
				
				<h2>What's Included in Toybox</h2>
				
				<p>Toybox includes a standard USB Mini-B cable and AC charging adapter. This cable not only charges the Toybox, but is also used to allow Toybox to connect to any computer with a USB port, enabling it to receive software updates and new activities. When connected to a computer, the Toybox mounts as a USB Mass Storage device. Toybox's internal storage comes in two sections: the Utility drive and the Storage drive. The Utility drive is where the Toybox Key software may be installed; installers are available for both Windows and Mac OS X.</p>

				<sup>1</sup>Yot will be customized to say this name by default when you receive your Toybox. The name may be changed later in the Parents Menu.<br>
				<sup>2</sup>This only affects which pronouns Yot will use to address your child. Toybox is designed to be gender-neutral in all other cases.<br>
				<sup>3</sup>The Toybox itself will always come in a grey shell. The chosen color will affect the included SuperFoam&trade; bumper case, as well as Yot's initial color.<br>
