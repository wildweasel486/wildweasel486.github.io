			<p>My name is <strong>Corwin Brence</strong>. I have been an enthusiast for all things creative since I was very young. Since 2000, I've been steadily learning all that there is to know about many design and creation programs for graphics, sounds, videos, and everything that one can conceivably create using a computer. I've also held a strong interest in drawing, photography, writing, and especially the design and creation of computer and video games.</p><br>
			
			<p>Between 2013 and 2016, I was a student at <strong>Portland Community College</strong> in their Multimedia program. There, I honed my skills in video editing, photo and image manipulation, web design, and writing both fiction and non-fiction.. I have already used those skills for numerous projects both personal and professional, and my work can be seen on websites like <strong>Hardcore Gaming 101</strong>, and my personal projects can be found throughout the Internet. This portfolio exists to document and catalog said projects.</p>
