			<p>I go by <strong>wildweasel</strong> on most parts of the internet. I used to think I was a big deal. These days I keep to myself. This page is being repurposed as my own personal hub. Were you looking for my professional portfolio? <a href="portfolio.html">Check here instead.</a></p>
			
			<h2>Reasons you might know me</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://gunlabs.blogspot.com/2011/01/weasels-mods.html">My mods for Doom and Doom II</a>. Or perhaps <a href="http://gunlabs.blogspot.com/2011/01/tutorials.html">the tutorials I used to write for mod-making</a> around 2011.
				<li><a href="https://wildweasel.itch.io/cola-3-the-soda-of-style">Cola 3: The Soda of Style</a>, the last Doom mod I've made to date. Well...the last big one.
				<li><a href="http://netizen.club/~wildweasel">Golfshrine Online</a>, my ridiculous quest to stuff bookshelves full of golf simulators. (Lord, help, this amount of golf isn't natural.)
				<li><a href="https://cohost.org/wildweasel">Here I am on Cohost</a>. I'm also <a href="https://computerfairi.es/@wildweasel">on mastodon/the fediverse</a> or whatever you want to call that.
				<li><a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/author/wildweasel/">A good handful of articles for Hardcore Gaming 101</a>, most prominently about the Wolfenstein games. Also appeared on a handful of their podcast episodes - I don't do that anymore though.
				<li>Over on Tumblr, <a href="https://weaselsblaugh.tumblr.com/">this is me</a>. I mostly just reblog random stuff. I did have a few sub-blogs over there, such as <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/reallycoolcockpits">Really Cool Cockpits</a>.
				<li>I've written fan fiction <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/ponderousferret">under an alias</a> over at AO3 for a couple years, primarily focusing on the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series. Oh, and <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/majima-everywhere-vignettes">this short-lived tumblr full of Majima Everywhere stuff</a> was also me. Don't worry, they're not all that explicit.
				<li><a href="https://thefriendlycard.wordpress.com/">Turn of a Friendly Card</a>, the solitaire blog I wrote (mostly) in 2017 and have updated sporadically ever since.
				<li>Lord forbid, <a href="https://www.digitalmzx.com/search.php?field=author&search=weasel">the things I used to do in MegaZeux</a> from 2001-2009. (Yeah, they're...not amazing. Gotta start somewhere, I guess.)
				<li>I'm somewhat talkative on a handful of Discord servers: HG101, ZDoom, Gaming Alexandria, Retro Dreams, Pixelated Audio, handful of others. Forgive me if I don't put my screen name on here but I'd really rather be in touch over something slower if you need to contact me that way.
			</ul>
			
			<p>Anyway, that's me. Not much else to this page besides that, haven't got a reason to put up anything else here. You want the real weasel content, you go seek that out instead of this page. A'ight? A'ight.</p>
