			<p>My name is <i>Corwin Brence</i>. I have been an enthusiast for all things creative since I was very young. Since 2000, I've been steadily learning all that there is to know about many design and creation programs for graphics, sounds, videos, and everything that one can conceivably create using a computer. I've also held a strong interest in drawing, photography, writing, and especially the design and creation of computer and video games.</p><br>
			
			<p>I was a student at <i>Portland Community College</i> in their Multimedia program, having graduated in early 2017. There, I honed my skills in video editing, photo and image manipulation, web design, and writing both fiction and non-fiction. These skills can already be seen in my professional work on websites like <i>Hardcore Gaming 101</i>. In my spare time, I've dabbled in video game design, by way of making mods for the popular computer game, <i>Doom</i>.</p>
